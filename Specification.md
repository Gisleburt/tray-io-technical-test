Technical Exercise
==================

Introduction
------------

You will write a web application that shows a web form to collect data from a user
before signing up for a service. See the screenshot below for possible design and
layout of requirements, but feel free to come up with your own design for the form if
there are changes you think would be an improvement.

Requirements
------------

You should at least:
- Build a GUI that:
  - Show one page of the form at a time.
  - Show the current page position of the form.
  - Validate the input fields upon submission of each page.
  - If there are any validation errors, show an error message in the form
    and block progress.
  - Console.logs the resultant data on the final page.
- Write tests and document for your code.

What we want to see
-------------------
This test focuses on readability + extensibility. We expect you to be able to explain,
without the need for you to fully implement in this test, how you would work on the
following topics and other related ones:
- How you would change the configuration of a certain page
- How you would add new pages
- How you would implement going back a page

Deliverable
-----------

The program:
- Can be written in any client-side programming language.
- Can make use of popular frontend libraries and frameworks. We use React
  and Redux in our applications so using these technologies in the test is
  preferable (unless you think we are missing out on the next big thing).
- Can make use of any existing open source libraries that don't directly
  address the problem statement (use your best judgement).
- Is compatible with the latest stable Chrome browser.

Please send us:
- The full source code, including any code written which is not part of the
  normal program run (scripts, tests).
- Clear instructions on how to obtain and run the program.
- Please provide any deliverables and instructions using a public Github (or
  equivalent) repository as several people will need to inspect the solution.

Evaluation
----------

The purpose of this exercise is for us to see some of the code you wrote and should
be proud of. We will especially consider:
- Overall user experience
- Clarity of instructions
- Code organisation
- Code quality
- Code documentation
We believe we can learn a lot from how you approach a small challenge like this and
think it can be fun to write as well! Please do take your time when implementing the
test. Feel free to ask any questions about it, about the role, or just about life at Tray.
Thanks for your time, and good luck on behalf of all the Tray.io Team!
